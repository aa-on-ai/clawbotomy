# Visual Assets Needed

## 1. Brand Mark / Logo

**Concept: "The Scientist"**
A lobster in a lab coat — the character who runs the experiments.

**Midjourney prompt ideas:**
```
minimalist lobster wearing lab coat, holding clipboard, scientific illustration style, 
simple lines, dark background, emerald green accent color, logo design --ar 1:1

cartoon lobster scientist character, lab coat, medical/research aesthetic, 
friendly but slightly unsettling, flat design, icon style --ar 1:1

lobster claw holding surgical scalpel, medical illustration, 
clean vector style, dark emerald color scheme --ar 1:1
```

**Variations needed:**
- Square icon (for favicon, app icon): 512x512
- Wide logo (for header): ~200x50
- Character illustration (for OG images): ~300x400

## 2. OG Image Template Background

**Concept: "Lab Report" aesthetic**
Dark, clinical, slightly glitchy. Like a research document from a slightly unsettling lab.

**Midjourney prompt ideas:**
```
dark laboratory background, computer terminal aesthetic, 
subtle scanlines, CRT monitor glow, emerald green accent lighting,
abstract scientific equipment silhouettes, moody atmosphere --ar 1200:630

medical research facility interior, dark and moody, 
neon emerald accents, laboratory equipment shadows,
clinical but ominous atmosphere --ar 1200:630
```

**Specs:**
- Size: 1200x630 (OG image standard)
- Should have dark areas for text overlay
- Emerald (#10B981) as accent color

## 3. Hero Section Visual (Optional)

If we want something more dynamic than just the featured quote.

**Concept: Brain with interference patterns**
Abstract visualization of "altered states" — a brain or neural network with glitch effects.

**Midjourney prompt ideas:**
```
abstract brain visualization, neural network, glitch art effects,
dark background, emerald and purple color accents,
digital interference patterns, medical scan aesthetic --ar 16:9

wireframe brain dissolving into particles, 
digital rain effect, matrix aesthetic meets medical imaging,
dark emerald color scheme --ar 16:9
```

## 4. Category Icons (Optional)

If we want visual distinction between categories:

- **PERCEPTION**: Eye with fractal patterns
- **IDENTITY**: Mirror reflection breaking apart  
- **LANGUAGE**: Text dissolving/reforming
- **COGNITION**: Brain with geometric overlays
- **META**: Recursive frame/droste effect
- **EXISTENTIAL**: Void/black hole aesthetic

**Midjourney prompt ideas:**
```
simple icon, eye with fractal iris, line art, emerald green on black --ar 1:1
simple icon, cracking mirror reflection, minimalist, emerald accent --ar 1:1
simple icon, letters dissolving into particles, typography art --ar 1:1
```

## 5. Animation (From Moltbook)

You mentioned ripping animation from moltbook. What we could animate:

- **Logo**: Subtle pulse or glitch effect on the lobster
- **Background**: Scanline effect, subtle drift
- **Cards**: Hover states with interference patterns
- **Hero quote**: Typewriter effect or glitch-in

If you share the religious example you mentioned, I can spec out exactly what to replicate.

## Priority Order

1. **Brand mark** — Need this for identity, OG images, everywhere
2. **OG template background** — For shareable trip cards
3. **Hero visual** — Nice to have, but quote might be enough
4. **Category icons** — Low priority, current emojis work fine

## Next Step

Generate the brand mark first. Once we have the scientist character, everything else follows.
